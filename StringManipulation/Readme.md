# String Manipulation

Series of problems and solutions to String manipulation in Python. Of course there are dozens of other ways to solve these problems.
Here is a breakdown of challenges and their descriptions

##

Suzuki is the master monk of his monastery so it is up to him to ensure the kitchen is operating at full capacity to feed his students and the villagers that come for lunch on a daily basis.

This week there was a problem with his deliveries and all the vegetables became mixed up. There are two important aspects of cooking in his kitchen, it must be done in harmony and nothing can be wasted. Since the monks are a record keeping people the first order of business is to sort the mixed up vegetables and then count them to ensure there is enough to feed all the students and villagers.

You will be given a string with the following vegetables:

"cabbage", "carrot", "celery", "cucumber", "mushroom", "onion", "pepper", "potato", "tofu", "turnip"
Return a list of tuples with the count of each vegetable in descending order. If there are any non vegetables mixed in discard them. If the count of two vegetables is the same sort in descending alphabetical order.

```javascript
(119, "pepper"),
(114, "carrot"),
(113, "turnip"),
(102, "onion"),
(101, "tofu"),
(100, "cabbage"),
(93, "mushroom"),
(90, "cucumber"),
(88, "potato"),
(80, "celery")
```

## Complete The Pattern

You have to write a function pattern which returns the following Pattern(See Pattern & Examples) upto n number of rows.

Note:Returning the pattern is not the same as Printing the pattern.
Rules/Note:

If n < 1 then it should return "" i.e. empty string.
There are no whitespaces in the pattern.
Pattern:

(n)(n-1)(n-2)...4321
(n)(n-1)(n-2)...432
(n)(n-1)(n-2)...43
(n)(n-1)(n-2)...4
...............
..............
(n)(n-1)(n-2)
(n)(n-1)
(n)
Examples:
```javascript
pattern(4):

4321
432
43
4
pattern(11):

1110987654321
111098765432
11109876543
1110987654
111098765
11109876
1110987
111098
11109
1110
11
```
Hint: Use \n in string to jump to next line
