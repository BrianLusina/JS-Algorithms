                Fill in the object constructor with the following methods below:
                getFirstName()
                getLastName()
                getFullName()
                setFirstName(first)
                setLastName(last)
                setFullName(firstAndLast)
                Run the tests to see the expected output for each method.
The methods that take an argument must accept only one argument and it has to be a string.

These methods must be the only available means of interacting with the object.
